## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

-- Building this made my Grid skills become sharpened. Seeing as I just decided to tackle a project before I begin a software engineering program with ALX in the coming weeks.

### Continued development

-- Going further, I would love to continue building more projects that require critical Flexbox and Grid thinking.

### Useful resources

-- Having a good knowledge of Grid and Flexbox is a plus to this project. So i would recommend understanding it deeply.
